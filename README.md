# Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project implements a **virtual keyboard** using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking. Users can type characters by moving their fingers over a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen. The system detects finger positions and recognizes gestures to simulate key presses.

## Features
- **Real-time hand tracking** using **MediaPipe Hands**.
- **Virtual QWERTY keyboard** displayed using OpenCV.
- **Gesture-based typing**: Press keys by bringing your index finger and thumb close together.
- **Mouse click support**: Toggle keyboard visibility and interact using mouse clicks.
- **Text input simulation** using the `pynput` library to send keystrokes.
- **Basic UI elements**: Spacebar, backspace, and clear button for text editing.
- **FPS display** to monitor performance.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7+ recommended). Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe pynput
```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The webcam will activate, and the virtual keyboard will appear when toggled.
3. Use your **index finger** to navigate and bring your **thumb close to your index finger** to press a key.
4. Alternatively, use **mouse clicks** to interact with keys.
5. Press `q` to **exit** the application.
